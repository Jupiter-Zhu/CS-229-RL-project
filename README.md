# CS 229 project

## Motivation

Our initial goal is to understand common techniques used in reinforcement learning.  In particular, we first sought to understand the methods and code used in [a link](https://medium.com/@gabogarza/deep-reinforcement-learning-policy-gradients-8f6df70404e6?fbclid=IwAR1mO7reVWv9ldNfBCWyTqHGZjvtMIGtGjfi1oV8sRrSpfSi5lCZHePZ1Ts}{medium.com/@gabogarza/deep-reinforcement-learning-policy-gradients), which enacts a policy gradient method to train an agent to play the LunarLander arcade game.  We then hope to practice applying other techniques tobetter learn Lunar Lander (such as deep Q learning).  Finally, we hope to ap-ply these techniques that work to learn arcade games to other, less conventialapplications, such as predicting the stock market.
